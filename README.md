 "Bringing computer science smarts to the masses
Home appliances, connected home, internet of things

The original goal of the Semantic Web was to provide an open framework for apps to integrate and reason across any data in any repository, anywhere. But the open standards that were introduced by the WC3, such as RDF and OWL have proved to be unwieldy and difficult for non-computer scientists to grasp.

Where CaaS comes in is that much of the reasoning capabilities that Semantic Web hoped to enable could now become simple APIs in the cloud that any developer can use, without needing a PhD. As we head toward 2020, CaaS will make the world more helpful. The cognitive operating system will reach out and connect our bodies and even REACH into them via augmented reality devices like Google Glass, and the quantified self movement.

Everything is going to get smarter. Your phone, your calendar, your watch, your radio, your TV, your car, your refrigerator, your house, your glasses, your briefcase and clothing. The vast cognitive capabilities of the global CaaS providers will be cheap and available via APIs to every device from the nano scale up to the giant global applications and services."
